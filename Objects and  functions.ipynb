Understanding OOP (Object oriented programming) was the hardest thing I had ever done.  I realized later that most of the problem was understanding a new vocabulary. Classes, instances, attributes, methods and constructors were the words used to describe an OOP object, but I really didn't understand what those words meant as they related to OOP. It was literally a foreign language to me. What made it worse was that I thought my previous programming background would have made it easy to understand.
